    <h2><br />About Gyre</h2>
    <p>
        I created Gyre because I like to look at my walls.
        Silly, I know, but I really don't like pegboard-style systems that cover large amounts of surface area.
        They just seem, well, inelegant. <br />
        I set out to design a system that only takes up wall space where it's needed, and leaves the rest open.
        Along the way, I discovered other perks, like the unique aesthetic and the super-satisfying 'click' that the
        parts make when they snap into place. <br/> Being relatively new to CAD modeling, the design process was a wonderful
        learning experience and ton of fun. I look foreword to building up the catalog of attachments and seeing what
        you all add to it as well. I hope you enjoy Gyre as much as I do. <br/>
