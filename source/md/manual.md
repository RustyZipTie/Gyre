# Gyre manual
## Welcome to the world of Gyre!
> In reality, this is less of a complete manual than a compilation of tips and tricks that I have stumbled upon in the process of designing and testing the system. I intend to continually update it as I learn more, and I hope to hear from all of you about what you have found that works and what doesn't. There is no single "correct" way to print or assemble Gyre- whatever works for you is what you should do.
